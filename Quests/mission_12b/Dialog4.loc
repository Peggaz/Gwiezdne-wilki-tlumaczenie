#L_D4_msg00=Will you look at that. Money's falling into our hands!
#L_D4_ans00=Shut your gob and get your boss on the line. I have a business proposal for him.
#L_D4_msg10=Yes, what the hell?! Who's there? Who are you morons? I don't know you, beat it.
#L_D4_ans10=We can scatter your gang in a second, so shut up and listen. I need somebody to kick up a fuss with a Triada patrol somewhere far from the central station. Nothing special, just a distraction. I'm willing to pay handsomely.
#L_D4_msg20=Yeah, you'd better pay well! We're going to strain relations with Triada, which means no more work for us.
#L_D4_ans20=Judging by the junk you fly on, you haven't had much work before anyway. Just tell me your price to save time.
#L_D4_msg30=We have enough work, but right now we're on vacation! All right, you have a deal. A fuss will cost you 100,000. No haggling.
#L_D4_ans30=How much?! Now I see why you're stuck in here - because of your overblown imagination. We'll manage without your help.
#L_D4_ans31=Agreed. You'll be paid by the job.
#L_D4_msg40=It's your call. We won't risk for a smaller sum. Now get lost, we're having a rest here.
#L_D4_ans40=(Dalej)
#L_D4_msg50=So, boss, let's visit the station?
#L_D4_ans50=Yeah, we'll do without helpers like those.
#L_D4_msg41=Shame on you for being so distrustful. We're honest businessmen.
#L_D4_ans41=For real? This goes straight into my Ridiculous Saying collection. Stop wasting time and get a job.
