#L_D8_msg00=SAM, can you call for backup now?
#L_D8_ans00=(Dalej)
#L_D8_msg10=Affirmative. But it will be heavily suppressed on entry. Many units will be destroyed.
#L_D8_ans10=This won't do us any good. All right, let's continue on our own. But I'll tell you, when we need them.
#L_D8_ans11=If you can't get us backup now, we're done for. Do it!
