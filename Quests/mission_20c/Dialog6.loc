#L_D6_msg00=You're making a mistake. My imperatives imply the top-priority desire for the wellbeing of the human race in general and the development of every individual.

Your destructive actions may only delay it - for another period of wars and bloodshed.
#L_D6_ans00=I think I've heard this before.
