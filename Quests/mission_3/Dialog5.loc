#L_D5_msg00=I said I could pay 5,000 credits, but I have another idea. What do you say about two Berserker lasers? These babies sure pack a punch. And they are rather hard to get.
#L_D5_ans00=Lasers are good, but what I need now is money.
#L_D5_ans01=I guess lasers will suit me better right now.
#L_D5_msg10=Great. Let me thank you on behalf of the New Empire and the entire trade fleet. Oh, and you shouldn't come close to the station - without that cargo.
#L_D5_ans10=Damn, I should've hired some mercs to deal with a pirate-related problem. What should I do now?
#L_D5_msg20=Which pirates are you talking about?
#L_D5_ans20=The Wild Dogs clan.
#L_D5_msg30=Oh, those. They have an enemy - the Wild Cats clan. Visit the Cats and tell them about finding Dogs' soft spot, they'll buy it. Good luck and don't worry about the cargo. You did right.
#L_D5_ans30=(Dalej)
