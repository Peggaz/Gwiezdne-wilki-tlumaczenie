#L_D15_msg00=Pirates again! Get your guns ready, we're not giving away the cargo without a fight!
#L_D15_ans00=Hey, hey, calm down. We're not pirates and we don't need your cargo.
#L_D15_msg10=Yeah, right. Wandering about on a pirate ship is just a hobby. Just to juice it up.
#L_D15_ans10=You're almost right. It's my trophy. Believe it or not, but I don't give a damn about you. So let's calm down and follow our own ways, ok?
#L_D15_msg20=Cancel the alert! Sorry for unfriendly reception, but pirates have really been thrashing us for the last three systems. We're afraid of our own shadows now.
#L_D15_ans20=Nevermind, I'm not offended.
#L_D15_msg30=Name's Matt. Listen, I have an offer. We're headed for a mine in Elio, but almost all our guards have been killed. Your firepower would surely come in handy. Though I can only pay you 12,500 credits.
#L_D15_ans30=Matt, aren't you daunted by the fact that you'll be protected by a pirate ship? Any patrol will chew us up.
#L_D15_msg40=Elio is defended by militia, they know me well. I'll just tell them you are with me, and no one will touch you. Do we have a deal?
#L_D15_ans40=Deal. All the more so it's on our way.
#L_D15_ans41=Sorry, I'd like to, but I can't, we're in such a hurry. Besides, as guards we'll only cause you more trouble.
#L_D15_msg50=Thanks! The Handers don't forget their friends.
#L_D15_ans50=(Dalej)
#L_D15_msg60=Wait, did you say Handers? Are you a relative of Carl Hander?
#L_D15_ans60=(Dalej)
#L_D15_msg70=He's my father. We run a family business in Elio.
#L_D15_ans70=(Dalej)
#L_D15_msg80=My, it's a small world. It's exactly your dad we're going to visit. He's my old friend. Anyway, we can chat later, give me the mine coordinates.
#L_D15_ans80=(Dalej)
#L_D15_msg51=Damn, it's a pity. Well, good luck.
#L_D15_ans51=(Dalej)
