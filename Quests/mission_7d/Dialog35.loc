#L_D35_msg00=Where to now, boss?
#L_D35_ans00=Right now I'm concerned with the debris of that grey fighter we've found. It would be reasonable to find something out at the Mercenary Market in Cassily.
#L_D35_ans01=It would be nice to get some information from the MSF. Why have they attacked a Triada system at all? We're going to New Jerusalem 2.
