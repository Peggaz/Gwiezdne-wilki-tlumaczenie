#L_D28_msg00=Partner, the thick skulls won't just let us go. Let's scram!
#L_D28_ans00=Where to?
#L_D28_msg10=To hell itself or whatever, just away from the imperial systems.
#L_D28_ans10=Let's try to find out what Triada knows about my convoy. We're going to Candela.
#L_D28_ans11=Greyhair, you mentioned the Mercenary Market in Cassily. We're going there. Might as well find something out about those fighter remains we've found.
#L_D28_ans12=Let's pause on the investigation and improve our financial status. My friend Alex is offering a one-time well-paid mission. Let's go to XT-54.
