#L_D15_msg00=I can see you did great. Now you have to-
#L_D15_ans00=Oh, just don't start on that track again! The deal was to place satellites.
#L_D15_msg10=Listen, we'll pay you 100,000 credits. You will just have to go a short way round and photograph an object of our interest. Or it's no deal!
#L_D15_ans10=Sure, fine, then it's no deal. We're leaving this system for it's too hot here - one detail you've forgotten to tell us about.
#L_D15_ans11=Well, it's ok as long as you pay. What's the object?
#L_D15_msg20=You wouldn't want to be on bad terms with our corporation.
#L_D15_ans20=I'm willing to risk it.
#L_D15_msg21=Actually we don't know it ourselves. The satellite has just detected it. Wait, here are the coordinates. We're waiting for intel. Good luck.
#L_D15_ans21=(Dalej)
#L_D15_msg31=I can't believe my ears, you bought it and agreed to run on another errand.
#L_D15_ans31=Ternie, 100 G's for a detour - this sounds like fine compensation.
#L_D15_msg41=Oh, partner, are you going to grow wiser? Look at the map. To get to the spot, we'll have to go a crazy way round patrols. Or fight every one of them.
#L_D15_ans41=(Dalej)
#L_D15_msg51=I vote for a fight. At least, they won't stab us in the back, if we're detected.
#L_D15_ans51=You may be right. But I vote for a safe journey.
#L_D15_ans52=I vote for fighting too.
#L_D15_msg61=Let me lay a course. Done!
#L_D15_ans61=(Dalej)
#L_D15_msg62=Then let's rush in headlong like space cowboys, which we are.
#L_D15_ans62=(Dalej)
