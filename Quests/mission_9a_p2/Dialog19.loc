#L_D19_msg00=Welcome to the Angarsk Station.
#L_D19_ans00=Hello there. I'd like in inquire about freelance job offers. Business has been going downhill recently. This way I won't have any cash for repairs and such before long.
#L_D19_msg10=Sorry to hear that. There's one offer: to deliver some cargo to the Bratsk Station. They're paying only 10,000 credits, but the way the safe. We'd deliver it ourselves, if we had any unassigned transports.
#L_D19_ans10=What kind of cargo? It won't explode or inflame, will it? I wouldn't like to risk it for just 10 grands.
#L_D19_msg20=The cargo is completely safe. It's certain electronics.
#L_D19_ans20=Well, it may be safe, but given the reward, it's only a waste of time.
#L_D19_ans21=The reward is still meager. Listen, friend, I know about your situation. Rumor has it that you need an independent transport to risk delivering a certain cargo to Muscovy. Getting my drift?
#L_D19_ans22=Well, the reward could be better, but we need every credit now, so it's a deal.
#L_D19_msg30=It's your call. Angarsk out.
#L_D19_ans30=(Dalej)
#L_D19_msg31=I sure do. Attention, security! We have a spy!
#L_D19_ans31=(Dalej)
#L_D19_msg41=That was unwise, boss. Let's scram!
#L_D19_ans41=(Dalej)
#L_D19_msg32=Excellent! The parcel for Bratsk is in your cargo bay. Oh, and I hope you won't try to escape the system with it. Not that we don't trust you, but the portal guards have been warned. Good luck.
#L_D19_ans32=(Dalej)
