#M_spec_Name_boost_1	= Boost 1
#M_spec_Desk_boost_1	= If you disable the onboard computer and take manual control of the ship, you can really boost engine power. This makes engines moan, ship chatter, and it seems like everything is going to rack and ruin... And it usually is, if the pilot is a rookie. However, a veteran will feel the limit and know when it's enough. Usually engines can work like that for about 20 seconds, no more. And you can't repeat the trick more than 2 times. However, during this time your ship will fly three or four times faster.

#M_spec_Name_boost_2	= Boost 2
#M_spec_Desk_boost_2	= If you disable the onboard computer and take manual control of the ship, you can really boost engine power. This makes engines moan, ship chatter, and it seems like everything is going to rack and ruin... And it usually is, if the pilot is a rookie. However, a veteran will feel the limit and know when it's enough. Usually engines can work like that for about 30 seconds, no more. And you can't repeat the trick more than 4 times. However, during this time your ship will fly three or four times faster.

#M_spec_Name_burst_1	= Burst 1
#M_spec_Desk_burst_1	= When a pilot gets carried away while pursuing an enemy, he starts peppering him from all of the guns that he has. While this doesn't add to accuracy, any target caught in such a hailstorm will be quickly eliminated. For 30 seconds the rate of fire of all fighter weapons increases by 50%. Due to severe wear it can be done only 2 times per mission.

#M_spec_Name_burst_2	= Burst 2
#M_spec_Desk_burst_2	= If you add a rate of fire upgrade to the indomitable desire for riddling the enemy with projectiles, the target will be raked so brutally that it will hardly survive. For 30 seconds the rate of fire of all fighter weapons increases by 75%. Due to severe wear it can be done only 3 times per mission.

#M_spec_Name_burst_3	= Burst 3
#M_spec_Desk_burst_3	= Even such a simple thing as "fly and fire" can be improved like any other ordinary skill. For 30 seconds the rate of fire of all fighter weapons increases by 100%. Due to severe wear it can be done only 5 times per mission.

#M_spec_Name_burst_4	= Burst 4
#M_spec_Desk_burst_4	= If a skill is honed, it eventually turns into art. This can also be said about firing long bursts "off the cuff". For 30 seconds the rate of fire of all fighter weapons increases by 133%. Due to severe wear it can be done only 8 times per mission.

#M_spec_Name_finesse_1	= Aimed Fire 1
#M_spec_Desk_finesse_1	= For 20 seconds the character focuses on aiming and fires at weak spots of the enemy ship. At that his accuracy increases by 50% and inflicted damage increases by 25%. This can only be done 2 times per mission.

#M_spec_Name_finesse_2	= Aimed Fire 2
#M_spec_Desk_finesse_2	= For 30 seconds the character focuses on aiming and fires at weak spots of the enemy ship. At that his accuracy increases by 75% and inflicted damage increases by 50%. This can only be done 3 times per mission.

#M_spec_Name_finesse_3	= Aimed Fire 3
#M_spec_Desk_finesse_3	= For 40 seconds the character focuses on aiming and fires at weak spots of the enemy ship. At that his accuracy increases by 100% and inflicted damage increases by 100%. This can only be done 5 times per mission.


#M_spec_Name_lucky_1	= Sixth Sense 1
#M_spec_Desk_lucky_1 = The character has a rare skill of extremely keen intuition in critical situations. In combat, he instinctively knows the best way to avoid enemy fire, and the best maneuvers to keep his ship's weak spots safe. Furthermore, he has time to coordinate the actions of his partners, and lets the entire team withdraw from heavy crossfire with minimum damage. However, this skill is so strenuous that the character can use it for only 30 seconds.

#M_spec_Name_lucky_2 = Sixth Sense 2
#M_spec_Desk_lucky_2 = The character just has to look at an enemy formation to realize which friendly targets will be fired at. By maneuvering and coordinating actions of his team, he manages to avoid most of enemy fire, even if it's very dense.

#M_spec_Name_missile_salvo_1	= Missile Salvo 1
#M_spec_Desk_missile_salvo_1	= The character fires a missile salvo at the target, increasing the effective rate of fire of all launchers by 50%.

#M_spec_Name_inspire_1	= Fervour 1
#M_spec_Desk_inspire_1	= The hero has authority over his team. So when he says to attack, all fighters, inspired by his example, do it without regard to enemy fire. Essentially, your attacks become more efficient, especially against superior enemy forces. However, pilots think less about their personal safety. Fervour lasts for 40 seconds and then ceases. It can be used 2 times during a mission.

#M_spec_Name_inspire_2	= Fervour 2
#M_spec_Desk_inspire_2	= With time hero's authority grows as does his influence on teammates. Now he can inspire them 3 times per mission for 60 seconds.

#M_spec_Name_snake_attack_1	= Darting Attack 1
#M_spec_Desk_snake_attack_1	= Taking manual control of engines and gyroscopes, the character can dramatically increase the maneuverability of his ship. Furthermore, it turns 3 times faster and its engines are boosted by 40%. It becomes more difficult for enemy ships to attack such a nimble target, so the odds of being hit are reduced by a factor of 1.5.

#M_spec_Name_weak_spot_1	= Deadly Missile 1 
#M_spec_Desk_weak_spot_1	= The character fires missiles like usual, but disables self-guidance and controls them manually, trying to hit a weak spot. This increases missile damage by a factor of 2.5. Besides, enemy antimissile systems are most often not designed to intercept missiles in the passive mode, so their efficiency decreases by 2 times. However, this requires much effort, since controlling both the ship and the fired missiles takes up most of your attention. This skill lasts for 30 seconds and can be used 2 times during a mission.

#M_spec_Name_summon_prec_1	= Summon Precursors 1
#M_spec_Desk_summon_prec_1	= Ternie is not sure how she manages to summon Precursor fighters. Some subtle mental link connects her with huge machines scattered across the universe - the witnesses of former greatness of a race long gone. Ternie says she can feel and even slightly control each mechanism. Currently she can summon 2 Precursor fighters to the battlefield, but this contact is too tiresome to maintain for a long time.
