#M_mail_torg2_Name = Appendix 1: Stare Imperium
#M_mail_torg2_LDesc =  Imperium zostalo oficjalnie zalozone w roku 2085, kiedy to feldmarszalek Joseph Durer, przywodca jednego z ziemskich klanow, oglosil sie cesarzem Josephem I. Jego rzady byly przez wielu okreslane jako bardzo okrutne, ale tez bardzo skuteczne. Umierajaca gospodarka planety zostala ozywiona, kolonie w innych systemach zostaly objete protektoratem Ziemi (ktora stala sie rowniez znana jako Sol-3), a piractwo na szlakach handlowych zostalo zakonczone.|Spokoj i dobrobyt trwaly do 2203 roku. Przodkowie Josepha prowadzili mniej surowa polityke, co spowodowalo pojawienie sie silnej opozycji. Korporacje Triada i USS wykorzystaly niestabilnosc rzadu, probujac intronizowac wlasnego protegowanego - Azara IV, kuzyna panujacego imperatora. Efektem tych dzialan byl przewrot. Imperator Elrud zostal zdetronizowany i stracony wraz z rodzina. Przyjaciele Elruda, wsrod ktorych byl prezes InoCo Corporation Marcus Reynolds, zdolali uratowac nowo narodzona corke cesarza - Astre. Aby uchronic dziecko przed kolejnymi atakami, Reynolds stwierdzil, ze Astra jest jego nieslubna corka i przyjal dziewczynke do swojej rodziny.|Reperkusje zmiany wladzy nie musialy dlugo wychodzic na powierzchnie - malwersacje i korupcja staly sie powszechne wsrod urzednikow Imperium. Korporacje, ktore pomogly Azarowi IV dojsc do wladzy, otrzymaly ulgi podatkowe, ale wkrotce zostaly zdradzone przez nowego imperatora. W ciagu pierwszych pietnastu lat swojego panowania zebral on najbardziej lojalnych ludzi i wszczepil ich do swojego rzadu. W tym okresie ludzkosc stanela w obliczu niezwykle agresywnej cybernetycznej formy zycia, ktora stala sie znana jako "berserkowie". Istoty te terroryzowaly odlegle galaktyki, atakujac kazdy statek, ktory pojawil sie w zasiegu ich wzroku. Chociaz ostatecznie zostaly pokonane i wymazane, berserki bardzo wyczerpaly MSF. Zanim Imperium zdazylo sie otrzasnac po wyniszczajacej wojnie, napotkalo nowe zagrozenie - rase wrogich obcych istot. Majac dobry pretekst do zgromadzenia duzej floty "obronnej", Imperator Azar IV przedstawil Korporacjom ultimatum, nakazujac im oddanie wszystkich statkow bojowych do MSF. Korporacje odpowiedzialy otwarta konfrontacja.|Konflikt pomiedzy obca forma zycia a Korporacjami wymknal sie calkowicie spod kontroli i wkrotce przerodzil sie w chaotyczna i wyniszczajaca wojne. Wielu westchnelo z ulga, gdy obcy nagle opuscili przestrzen Imperium i znikneli, ale Imperatorowi natychmiast przedstawiono kolejnego przeciwnika - corke poprzedniego imperatora, Astre, ktora zalozyla Nowe Imperium i zdolala pozyskac po swojej stronie wielu poteznych zwolennikow. Pierwszy powazny konflikt pomiedzy imperiami kosztowal je prawie wszystkie sily militarne, a wojna szybko zmienila sie z fazy aktywnej na defensywna.|Dzisiaj sily MSF sa skoncentrowane glownie w regionach graniczacych z Nowym Imperium oraz z obszarami kontrolowanymi przez Korporacje. Prowadzi to do slabego bezpieczenstwa w systemach centralnych, gdzie ataki piratow na transporty cywilne sa uwazane za rzecz oczywista. Flota MSF sklada sie w wiekszosci z okretow trzeciej generacji ze standardowym wyposazeniem, choc ostatnio zaczela otrzymywac bardziej zaawansowane jednostki, a nierzadko w ich szeregach mozna spotkac okrety czwartej lub piatej generacji, ktore wczesniej wydawane byly jedynie silom specjalnym. Ciagle ataki wroga i obfitosc piratow spowodowaly bezkompromisowa postawe MSF i gwaltowna reakcje na kazde naruszenie, niewazne jak malo znaczace. Pomimo tego wszystkiego, czlonkowie Free Traders Union otrzymuja calkowity dostep do wszystkich systemow i prawie wszystkich stacji przestrzeni Imperium.|General Database of Free Traders Union|Section XII-a, item 23


#M_mail_torg3_Name = Appendix 2: Nowe Cesarstwo i NESF
#M_mail_torg3_LDesc = Po tym jak Astra Reynolds ujawnila swoje prawdziwe pochodzenie, do jej macierzystego systemu Llanowar, w ktorym stacjonowal rowniez legendarny pluton Gwiezdnych Wilkow, przybyla duza liczba emisariuszy i ambasadorow z innych systemow. Rzady wielu systemow uznaly Astre za jedyna prawowita wladczynie Imperium i wierzyly, ze moze ona przywrocic mu dobrobyt widziany za czasow panowania Elruda. Prosili o jej patronat, w zamian oferujac czesci swoich sil policyjnych i obronnych, ktore zostaly wykorzystane do stworzenia wlasnej floty nowego Imperium. Nazwa "Nowe Imperium" pojawila sie naturalnie, gdyz ludzie chcieli odroznic swoj nowy dom od imperium rzadzonego przez Azara IV. Stare Imperium bylo zajete wlasnymi problemami i poczatkowo nie zwracalo wiekszej uwagi na masowa dezercje systemow w sektorze Phoenix, jednak po uswiadomieniu sobie zagrozenia zaczelo podejmowac brutalne dzialania, aby zapobiec dalszej dezercji.| Poczatkowo Flota Kosmiczna Nowego Imperium skladala sie z pilotow patrolowych i policyjnych wysylanych z innych systemow oraz wlasnych sil obronnych Llanowaru. Pozniej dolaczyli do nich najemnicy, a takze piraci z poteznego niegdys klanu Wyrzutkow, ktorzy przezyli Upadek Tytana - decydujaca operacje Imperium o charakterze kontrrewolucyjnym. Ta ostatnia doprowadzila do tego, ze imperialne mass media nazwaly Nowe Imperium "melina turian, piratow i mordercow".|Nowe Imperium nie byloby w stanie przeciwstawic sie MSF, gdyby nie pomoc korporacji InoCo, ktora kierowal syn Marcusa Reynoldsa i przyrodni brat Cesarzowej, Oliver Reynolds. InoCo nie tylko wyprodukowalo setki mysliwcow dla Nowego Imperium, ale takze przeprowadzilo zakrojona na szeroka skale modernizacje juz istniejacych, wyposazajac je w zaawansowane systemy uzbrojenia i nawigacji, a wszystko to w scisle okreslonym terminie. Dodatkowo, z MSF do NESF ucieklo wielu oficerow i pilotow. Wedlug nich, nie mogli dalej sluzyc w armii, ktora stosuje brutalne i czesto barbarzynskie dzialania wobec cywilow, aby "dac im nauczke". Ci sami ludzie okazali sie pozniej kluczowi dla udanego pokonania flot MSF podczas operacji Redemption.|Pomimo dobrego wyszkolenia, scislej dyscypliny i wysokiego morale wojsk NESF, a takze pomocy korporacji InoCo, Nowe Imperium po prostu nie posiada wystarczajacej liczby pilotow, aby zapewnic odpowiednia ochrone wszystkim swoim regionom. W kilku systemach obowiazki egzekwowania prawa zostaly powierzone lokalnym milicjom lub najbardziej autorytatywnym rodzinom. Za najlepiej broniony system uwaza sie Llanowar 2, gdzie znajduje sie Dwor Imperialny i rzad Nowego Imperium, najbardziej zagrozonym systemem jest Achilles, ktory nie posiada nawet placowki NESF. System Cassily jest siedziba Gieldy Najemnikow, ktora prowadzi swoja dzialalnosc pod nadzorem Nowego Imperium. Flota NESF sklada sie glownie ze standardowych statkow trzeciej generacji. Ostatnio korporacja InoCo zaczela zaopatrywac flote w bardziej zaawansowany sprzet, ale statki czwartej i piatej generacji wciaz mozna spotkac tylko wsrod sil specjalnych Nowego Imperium. Terroryzowane przez piratow okrety NESF moga reagowac na lamanie prawa agresja, ale z reguly staraja sie raczej schwytac naruszycieli, niz ich zabic. Nowe Imperium jest swiadome, ze handel jest najlepszym sposobem na wzmocnienie jego gospodarki, wiec czlonkowie FTU maja nieograniczony dostep do praktycznie wszystkich systemow i stacji. ||Ogolna baza danych Unii Wolnych Kupcow|Sekcja XII-a, pozycja 24

#M_mail_torg4_Name = Appendix 3: Korporacje
#M_mail_torg4_LDesc = Do niedawna prawie cala zamieszkana przestrzen byla kontrolowana przez trzy wielkie korporacje - InoCo, USS i Triada. Droga do dobrobytu InoCo staly sie zaawansowane technologicznie badania naukowe oraz produkcja wysokiej klasy sprzetu i narzedzi. USS kontroluje wieksza czesc rynku sprzetu AGD i produkuje rozne inne urzadzenia, natomiast Triada dominuje na rynku profesjonalnym dzieki unikalnym stopom i kompozytom do roznorodnych maszyn i innych zastosowan przemyslowych. Poza legalnym biznesem, Triada jest rowniez jednym z najwiekszych graczy na czarnym rynku i czesto korzysta z uslug przemytnikow i piratow w swojej dzialalnosci.|Korporacje roznia sie rowniez forma zarzadzania. Triada, jako najstarsza z calej trojki, siega czasow przed powstaniem Starego Imperium. Rzadzona jest przez klany rodzinne, na czele ktorych stoi Triumwirat Starszych. USS rzadzone jest przez Zgromadzenie Udzialowcow, a organem zarzadzajacym InoCo jest Rada Dyrektorow. Rozne metody zarzadzania skutkuja roznym podejsciem do biznesu. Triada oferuje towary przyzwoitej jakosci w rozsadnych cenach i moze zapewnic freelancerom prace na zlecenie, choc w wiekszosci nielegalna i czesto zwiazana z podejmowaniem ryzyka. USS, ze swoimi stacjami rozsianymi po calym wszechswiecie, zawsze dba o dobre zabezpieczenie i przewoznikow dla swoich karawan. Jesli chodzi o towary handlowe, sklepy USS oferuja najszersza game towarow i sprzetu, od surowcow po nowoczesne statki kosmiczne. InoCo uwazane jest za najbardziej samodzielna firme, ktora rzadko ubiega sie o uslugi wolnych handlarzy. Ceny w sklepach InoCo sa wysokie, ale sprzet na sprzedaz jest najwyzszej klasy.|Przed wojna domowa korporacje byly w stanie intensywnej rywalizacji, walczac o imperialne zamowienia na nowe statki i sprzet. Kiedy sytuacja na swiecie ulegla zmianie, korporacje musialy wycofac sie do swoich dobrze chronionych systemow bazowych i rozpoczac aktywne poszukiwanie nowych sojusznikow. W pewnym momencie Triada i USS polaczyly sily przeciwko Imperium. InoCo natomiast poparlo Nowe Imperium. Obecnie sojusz Triady i USS otwarcie walczy przeciwko Staremu Imperium, czasami angazujac sie w lokalne konfrontacje z Nowym Imperium i InoCo. Aby uniknac dywersji i prowokacji, ta ostatnia zdecydowala sie zamknac swoje systemy dla wszystkich bez specjalnej przepustki.|FTU stanowczo odradza proby dostania sie do obszarow zastrzezonych InoCo bez pozwolenia i radzi zachowac ostroznosc podczas pobytu w systemach USS, a zwlaszcza Triady, ktore sa czesto odwiedzane przez mniej praworzadnych drifterow w poszukiwaniu pracy. Lokalizacje glownych siedzib sa nastepujace: Triada - system Candela, USS - system El Ariash, InoCo - system Lidau. W swoich flotach korporacje zatrudniaja glownie statki drugiej i czwartej generacji, choc ich najwazniejsze miejsca sa zwykle strzezone przez statki piatej generacji. Chociaz Triada i USS pozwalaja czlonkom FTU na swobodne poruszanie sie po swoich systemach, korporacje posiadaja bezpieczne obszary zastrzezone, do ktorych nie nalezy wchodzic bez odpowiednich zezwolen.|General Database of Free Traders Union|Section XIX-biz, item 46

#M_mail_torg5_Name = Appendix 4: Piraci i najemnicy
#M_mail_torg5_LDesc = Niestabilnosc polityczna i niezdolnosc rzadu do utrzymania porzadku w systemach gwiezdnych doprowadzily do znacznego wzrostu aktywnosci piratow w wiekszosci regionow. Piractwo zawsze bylo problemem w Imperium, ale piraci z przeszlosci w niczym nie przypominali wspolczesnego "czarnego bractwa". Byli to przewaznie buntownicy szukajacy przygod, ktorzy tworzyli klany i zyli zgodnie z ich milczacym kodeksem honorowym. Atakowali tylko duze karawany rzadowe, zawsze dawali swoim ofiarom mozliwosc poddania sie i nigdy nie krzywdzili cywilow.|Wspolczesni piraci nie cofna sie przed niczym, aby osiagnac zysk. Wsrod nich sa tzw. "padlinozercy" - maruderzy, ktorzy pladruja pola bitew w poszukiwaniu cennych czesci i sprzetu. Padlinozercy gorliwie chronia swoje terytoria i atakuja kazdego, kto osmieli sie na nie wkroczyc. Wiekszosc piratow stara sie po prostu zarobic latwe pieniadze, a potem wrocic do normalnego zycia, dlatego rzadko kiedy pozwalaja uciec swiadkom swoich zbrodni. Poza maruderstwem, napadami i zabijaniem, jednymi z najbardziej popularnych i lukratywnych zajec piratow sa przemyt, niewolnictwo i rozne dywersje. Piraci maja rowniez wiele interesow z Triada Corporation, ktora chetnie dostarcza im nowoczesny sprzet i kupuje ich lupy. Obecnie nie ma zbyt wielu klanow pirackich, a wszystkie walcza ze soba o kontrole szlakow handlowych i ostatnich pol bitewnych. Czasami kilka klanow moze polaczyc sily, by przeprowadzic wspolne najazdy, a nawet obalic lokalne wladze, choc przypadki przejmowania przez piratow roli rzadu sa dosc rzadkie. Miejscami o najwiekszej aktywnosci piratow sa systemy korporacji Triada oraz systemy niezalezne, ktore nie zostaly zgloszone przez zadnego uczestnika obecnego konfliktu. Piraci sa zazwyczaj slabo zorganizowani i wyposazeni, choc zdarzaja sie klany, ktore dysponuja zaawansowanym sprzetem, silna struktura dowodzenia i surowa dyscyplina.|Historycznie, najgorszym wrogiem piratow nie byla policja czy wojsko, ale raczej najemnicy. Ci potezni piloci, glownie byli oficerowie rzadowi, znani sa z ogromnego doswiadczenia bojowego, twardej jak stal dyscypliny i niezrownanych umiejetnosci pilotazu. Za odpowiednia zaplate sa gotowi podjac sie kazdego legalnego zadania, czy to eskortowania statku handlowego, pelnienia warty, czy tez likwidacji zagrozenia pirackiego na danym obszarze. Nowe Imperium rowniez korzysta z uslug najemnikow w celu utrzymania porzadku w swoich systemach. Zazwyczaj najemnicy posiadaja zaawansowany sprzet i nieskazitelna reputacje, choc zdarzaja sie grupy zoltodziobow, ktore nie posiadaja ani jednego, ani drugiego. Takie grupy zazwyczaj trzymaja sie pracy we wlasnych systemach, dopoki nie zdobeda przynajmniej troche zasobow i slawy. Uslugi eskortowe najemnikow sa uwazane za jedyna przekonujaca gwarancje bezpiecznej podrozy kupca.|Generalna baza danych Unii Wolnych Kupcow|Sekcja XIX-biz, pozycja 47

#M_mail_torg6_Name = Appendix 5: Berserks, Aliens
#M_mail_torg6_LDesc = Te dwie rasy stanowily duze zagrozenie dla ludzkosci w czasach przed wojna domowa, a ich pokonanie przyszlo za nie mala cene. W koncu wyszlo na jaw, ze berserki, ktore mialy cybernetyczne pochodzenie, zostaly stworzone przez sztuczna inteligencje opracowana dla rzadu Imperium przez InoCo Corporation. Blad w bazie algorytmicznej Berserka (glownego komputera SI) pozwolil mu dzialac poza swoim poziomem tolerancji i uciec w niezbadana przestrzen. Przez dlugi czas o Berserku nie slyszano, dopoki systemy graniczne nie zaczely wysylac sygnalow alarmowych opowiadajacych o nieznanych napastnikach. Jak sie pozniej okazalo, Berserk chcial unicestwic ludzkosc i zaludnic systemy cybernetycznymi formami zycia. Po ustaleniu lokalizacji glownego komputera Berserka, MSF przeprowadzilo zakrojona na szeroka skale operacje i zdolalo zniszczyc SI wraz ze wszystkimi jej kopiami.|Rasa obcych istot zostala odkryta przez ludzkosc przypadkowo, kiedy MSF znalazlo portal nadprzestrzenny wykonany w nieznanej technologii w systemie XT-20. Imperator Azar IV postanowil wykorzystac to odkrycie do zaszczepienia wsrod ludzi ksenofobii i obaw przed inwazja obcych, aby mieli mniej trudnosci ze zgromadzeniem duzej armii do walki z Korporacjami. Sami Obcy nie chcieli walczyc z ludzmi - jakis czas pozniej wyslali przez portal poslanca, ktorego misja bylo uznanie ich dobrej woli i zawarcie porozumienia pokojowego z ludzkoscia. Poslaniec stanowil duze zagrozenie dla planow Imperatora, ktory nakazal zniszczyc Obcego. Zostalo to slusznie uznane przez rase obcych za akt agresji i nie trzeba bylo dlugo czekac na wybuch wojny na calego. Ich przewaga technologiczna pozwolila Obcym na calkowite zmiecenie sil imperialnych w ciagu kilku dni. Duza liczba systemow Imperium znalazla sie wkrotce pod ich kontrola. Ich statki wydawaly sie niepokonane, a zadna zbroja nie mogla oprzec sie ich broni. Sytuacja nieco sie zmienila, gdy ludzcy naukowcy znalezli sposob na skuteczne unieszkodliwianie statkow Obcych, ale do zwyciestwa wciaz bylo daleko. Decydujaca rola w tym konflikcie nalezala do korporacji InoCo, ktora znalazla sposob na komunikacje z Obcymi i wyjasnila im, ze ludzkosc dzieli sie na kilka grup, a oni niestety trafili na najbardziej agresywna. Najwyrazniej zadowoleni z tego wyjasnienia, Obcy odwolali wszystkie swoje sily i wrocili do swojej przestrzeni, niszczac po drodze portal.|Nie widziano od tamtej pory zadnych Obcych ani berserkow, chociaz istnieja pogloski o obserwacjach tych ras na obrzezach zamieszkanej przestrzeni. Plotki te nie maja jednak zadnych realnych dowodow na potwierdzenie.|Generalna Baza Danych Unii Wolnych Kupcow|Sekcja XIX-biz, pozycja 48

Powiem ci w skrocie, czego sie dowiedzialem o taktyce walki roznych frakcji. Watpie, by cos sie zmienilo w tej sferze w czasie, gdy bylem poza akcja.|Po pierwsze, MSF. Ci faceci maja dosc przecietne statki i sprzet, ale sa dobrze wyszkoleni i zdyscyplinowani. Nie spodziewaj sie, ze podejma walke nie majac dobrego planu ataku i przygotowanego oddzialu posilkow. To czyni ich niebezpiecznym przeciwnikiem. Jesli kiedykolwiek znajdziesz sie w potyczce z MSF, lepiej nie probowac szczescia i po prostu bic sie po nogach. |NESF.

Nie wiem nic o ich statkach i dzialach, ale jesli rzeczywiscie maja wielu ludzi z wojska Azara, to mozna oczekiwac od nich zachowania podobnego do MSF: atak, po ktorym nastepuje taktyczny odwrot w celu przegrupowania i oczekiwania na posilki, a nastepnie uderzenie wykanczajace.|USS - ci faceci sa zarowno dobrze wyszkoleni, jak i dobrze wyposazeni. Ich oddzialy wojskowe skladaja sie z raczej malych grup, ale kazda z nich wykazuje sie swietna praca zespolowa. Ich bronia sa dziala plazmowe, ktore sa trudne do uzycia przeciwko zwinnym celom, ale za to zadaja powazny cios. Za moich czasow ich oddzialy podrozowaly bez zadnej dodatkowej oslony, ale nie liczylbym na to teraz, kiedy kazda korporacja jest praktycznie zamknieta w swoim systemie macierzystym.|Wojsko Triady uwielbia duze dziala i aktywnie wykorzystuje rakiety. Jej glowna slaboscia jest fakt, ze jej piloci dzialaja indywidualnie. Nie sa dobrzy w pracy zespolowej, a ponadto wiele klanow Triady nie jest ze soba w najlepszych stosunkach. Nie rusza sie z miejsca, aby pomoc komus z przeciwnego klanu, nawet jesli ten biedak zostanie rozerwany na strzepy na ich oczach.|InoCo - maja lepsze statki i bardzo dobra bron. Ich piloci przechodza dobre szkolenie taktyczne i maja duze umiejetnosci pracy w zespole. Wola podrozowac w malych grupach i uzywac broni o wysokiej precyzji, co czyni ich swietnymi w walce na dalekie odleglosci. Nie sa tak dobrzy w zwarciu, ale mimo to, ci faceci sa sila, z ktora nalezy sie liczyc w kazdej sytuacji.|W odniesieniu do piratow, znalem kilka silnych klanow, ale Ternie mowi, ze w dzisiejszych czasach sa to tylko drobni rabusie bez dobrego sprzetu i pieniedzy. No nie wiem, ja bym mimo wszystko uwazal na nich. W kazdym razie to piraci, a ich najczestsza taktyka walki jest atakowanie w duzej liczbie. Rzadko zobaczysz ich uciekajacych, nawet jesli szanse sa przeciwko nim. Nie ma to nic wspolnego z odwaga, po prostu nie maja innego wyjscia: jesli piratowi uda sie uciec w kapsule ratunkowej, w koncu zostanie zlapany przez policje, a nawet jesli znajdzie go jakis inny piracki klan, najprawdopodobniej albo zostawi go na smierc w kapsule, albo sprzeda na targu niewolnikow. Badz wiec przygotowany na walke na smierc i zycie, gdy bedziesz walczyl z piratami.|Oddzialy najemnikow sa najtrudniejsze do zdefiniowania. Ich poziom umiejetnosci i wyposazenia jest bardzo zroznicowany, podobnie jak ich taktyka i wybor broni. Pierwsza rzecza, jaka powinienes zrobic podczas walki z najemnikami, jest przyjrzenie sie ich formacji: ci, ktorzy uzywaja rakiet, zazwyczaj oddzielaja sie od reszty i pozostaja dalej od akcji.

But as it turned out, what happened in reality was nowhere close to the official description.|There was no riot in New Donbass, although the miners did go on strike, driven to despair by the lack of proper health service, extremely hazardous working conditions, ridiculously low salaries and highly overstated production quotas from imperial officials. The system's governor turned to his relative, the Empire's flag officer Heder, asking him to bring a squad of MSF troopers and drive the workers to the mines on pain of being shot. His request was granted, and the Emperor's "Black guard" - a team of professionals notorious for their barbarity - was sent to the system. We were able to learn that by the time the guard was sent to New Donbass, it has already been on several other operations and kept going almost solely on stimulants. The landing at the New Donbass' central station proceeded as planned, the hangar with the guard's ships was left to be patrolled by local security forces and the Emperor's guardsmen entered the station. Even our sources could not find out what exactly happened next, but in the end the guardsmen opened fire and killed the entire population of the station including the system's governor, who was arrested by the miners and held in his cabin. An eyewitness reports that after this operation the corpses of men, women, children and aged people were stacked in a hangar and later loaded in a ship without identification markings... The people who lived at the station were later declared migrants, but it is clear that none of them reached their destination systems. The location of the "Black guard" remains unknown, and the local security which patrolled their ships was kindly offered to forget everything they saw. Considering that all the patrol officers have families in New Donbass, the offer no doubt took effect.|New Donbass, we promise to find the criminals responsible for such a horrible act, and even if we're unable to take them to court, we'll make sure their names will be out in the open!|Studio 66 - bringing you news without lies and prejudices.

Traders, like all normal people who don't want to risk their lives for nothing, now will surely favor imperial sectors over our systems when deciding where to conduct business. It's doubtful that MSF doers, who always took tolls from traders, will suddenly start honest lives, but they will surely have to tame their appetites. It's also unlikely that the NESF has enough ships to clear its systems from pirates, but the specified trade routes will surely be a lot safer than previously.|It is clear that we won't be able to beat the empires in terms of either prices on goods transportation or safety of trade routes.

#M_news_005_2_LDesc = A special unit of MSF has carried out a brilliant operation to eliminate pirates in Pegas system. According to the MSF captain in charge of the operation, a whole pirate treasury was eliminated. The treasury had been laundering money and selling equipment to clans which plundered not just the neighboring systems, but neighboring sectors as well. Unfortunately, the treasury couldn't be captured because the pirates had time to activate a self-destruction system, but then a trader was saved who must have been captured by pirates. As flag-admiral James Hader said, 'while some people try to solve the problem of piracy by producing worthless papers, MSF acts, and acts effectively.'|IGNA - your most authoritative news source.

#M_news_005_3_LDesc = An encounter between NESF ships, which were looking for and destroying pirate clans, and a detachment of MSF, which was robbing flying-by traders and local miners, happened today in Debris-1 system. According to the head of the New Empire security service, Red Corsair, Debris complex has always been a strategically important part of the outer space, but only those respected and trusted by the local population can control it. That's why a shock unit of NESF was secretly transferred to the system: to earn this respect by destroying pirates and defending miners. According to Corsair, our military were aware of the presence of an MSF detachment in the system, but tried to avoid contact which might complicate political situation. However, when the facts of plunder and extortion on the part of MSF came to light, the shock group commander decided to put an end to the outrage. According to Corsair, the actions of the commander, A.S. Kyrill, were found conforming to the principles of the space law and were highly appreciated by Empress Astra. The evidence of the criminal activities of the MSF was submitted to the Prosecutor General of the Old Empire, Andrew Fox, but he didn't comment on the situation.|You're with the Voice of the New Empire, stay tuned.

However, the corporation strives for peace and elimination of piracy, as do most people of neutral systems, and does its best to achieve it. According to Mr. Fry, the USS is experiencing the same problems as the neutral systems - its infrastructure is practically destroyed, its stations isolated and regular freight traffic impossible because of the confrontation with the MSF.

Well, nothing to look forward to.|The pirates, having lost their money, will become fiercer, their attacks will become bolder, and the least defended systems will be the first to suffer from these attacks.

#M_news_005_13_LDesc = The governors of neutral system at their emergency meeting decided to introduce a special license to rake through wreckage of ships and stations left after the battles in Capricorn sector. The supporters of this idea claim that the sale of licenses and a recovered treasures tax which the scavengers will have to pay will not only replenish the treasury coffers of the systems but will enable law-abiding citizens to take up the trade. At the moment the search of wreckage on the battlefields is considered looting and is punished by a large fine and imprisonment for up to 3 years. Only special governmental services can deal with wreckage, they also provide fitting burial for the fallen and inform their relatives. At the moment wreckage attracts attention of looters, known as 'scavengers', who are unlikely to have respect for the fallen pilots.

#M_news_006_1_Name = Glory to the heroes!
#M_news_006_1_LDesc = A crushing defeat was suffered by the pirates who tried to attack a trading caravan going from Corrino to XK-16. The criminals laid an ambush in Prien and, according to the fleet intelligence, knew the precise route of the ships as well as the strength of their guard. But they didn't take into account the courage and resourcefulness of the MSF warriors, who spotted the trap in time and launched a pre-emptive strike! Some time later reinforcements arrived, which effectively put paid to most pirates' careers. But though this incident had a happy end, a question remains: how did the pirates learn about the caravan and its route? The MSF officers and traders say that several clans took part in the attack. This fact shows that the pirates knew about the caravan long before its start and managed not only to coordinate their efforts, but to prepare properly. Right honorable Lord Aner Gee, an Imperial secretariat's official, though refusing to mention any names, recommended looking into which security service is headed by an ex-pirate and who benefits from presenting the MSF in an unfavorable light.

According to the fleet intelligence the pirates knew the precise route of the ships as well as their guards' resources. The pirates waited for them to approach and then shot them almost point-blank.

This time the governors of the systems decided to reform the system of taxation of private businesses. Before the war entrepreneurs paid taxes according to a form set by the Empire, a copy of which they sent to local tax service offices. Then the Empire just transferred to the systems part of the taxes according to the set individual rates. However none of the systems, including those still officially controlled by the MSF, has received any money for the last tax year, though our agency knows for sure that the Imperial bank continued to receive taxes, even if in lesser amounts. The governors of the systems decided to take taxation under local control and keep all the payments on the systems' accounts, not dividing them with the Empire. Moreover, the governors promise that thus it will be possible to lower tax rates for businessmen. The idea in general has sense, but if you take into account the fact that XT-17, XT-19 and XT-27 have long become pirate enclaves, the taxes are unlikely to be used for systems' improvement and law enforcing.

#M_news_008_1_LDesc = A terrible explosion totally destroyed the central station in Dionysus system. Unfortunately, there is no information about casualties and the cause of the explosion - the New Empire carefully conceals the facts, however the fleet intelligence suspects that what happened was the detonation of the rocket arsenal, secretly established by the NESF in the holds of the station. The ammunition was secretly delivered by free traders under the guise of humanitarian cargo. Not long before the tragedy one of these smugglers entered Dionysus, while the MSF did everything in its power to detain him.|By the way, the NESF has its own explanation for the incident, according to which the guilty party was...the MSF! If the official propaganda spread by the court of Astra is to be trusted, right after the explosion the MSF's unit under the command of Major Viper 'burst' into the system. This, presumably, testifies to the fact that this act of terrorism was developed by a specialist in similar operations (i.e. Major Viper) and was part of a plan to capture the system. Major Viper objects that should such plan exist, Dionysus would have long be captured.

Neither we have reliable information about casualties, but if the claims of the New Empire can be believed the majority of the population managed to get evacuated.|Meanwhile, the court of Astra decided to use this incident to throw propagandist mud at the MSF. An ex-pirate, now the head of the New Empire Security Service, Corsair, says that the breakdown in the reactor has been caused by an MSF's saboteur. Moreover, he asserts that shortly before the tragedy, a trader told station's guard that he had been forced by Major Viper of the MSF Security Service, who used blackmail and intimidation, to take a bomb aboard his ship that was meant for the station. The absurdity of this accusation becomes evident when you remember that any patrol or war ship has a neutrino scanner, which detects any known explosive hidden behind walls of any ship or container.

According to Corsair, there is more than enough information to establish precisely who commissioned the act of terrorism, who planned it and who carried it out.

According to Corsair, there is more than enough information to establish precisely who commissioned the act of terrorism, who planned it and who carried it out. All these people will get their just deserts. Sources close to the Court say 'fury' is far too mild a word to describe Empress Astra's feelings, and only entreaties of her closest advisers keep her from immediate retaliation.|NESF's military intelligence has information that the MSF had already tried to deliver to the station a bomb, hidden in a special container immune to stock military scanners. Major Viper of the Old Empire Security Service used blackmail and threats to force a trader to act as a 'courier'. However, having entered Dionysus, the trader immediately alerted the system's guard and told them, who was behind the provocation. There is every reason to believe that by this time an MSF agent had been planted on the station, who decided to sabotage the station's reactor after the plan to smuggle in the bomb failed.|Fortunately, the station's population was evacuated before the explosion, but the station itself is lost.|You're with the Voice of the New Empire, stay tuned.

It was reported from XT-54 that the fight there had turned into carnage with at least 5 different sides taking part, though we don't know which. Neither do we know what made InoCo do such a trick, since most corporation's ships returned to XT-54 after the blitzkrieg, which they left shortly afterwards.|On the bright side, the civilian population of XT-54 didn't suffer during the fight of the corporations, and communication with the system is restored.|Studio 66 - bringing you news without lies and prejudices.

It's well known one of the most widespread pirate tactics is the so-called "live bait", when an accidental passerby proposes to a pilot to go for a certain cargo stored far from trade and patrol lanes. The pilots are lured into a trap by false SOS signals, and careful traders who ignore such tricks can be shadowed by the criminals. And if a trader or a station inhabitant often cannot notice he is a subject of active criminal interest, it's up to the vigilant side observer to rise to the occasion and save the victim's life, and transfer another pack of scum to the authorities. In the course of this program all willing citizens will be taught the skills to determine shadowing of someone, recognize signs of breaking in, robbery or preparation of a terrorist act.|You're with the Voice of the New Empire, stay tuned.

According to the official statement, separatist agents sneaked onto one of the stations in the system, turning its cargo hold into a fighter assembly hangar. Ship parts and weapons were delivered disassembled by a trader who plied between Muscovy and Angarsk and supposedly transported ordinary electronics and humanitarian supplies. His Majesty's Flag Admiral James Hader noted that this is not the first case when criminals calling themselves "New Empire" try to smuggle military goods under the ruse of "ordinary shipments".|Meanwhile according to the governor-general Mikhailo Gorbatenko, there's no merit of the General Staff in disarming the saboteurs at all - and there never was, a group lead by major Viper acted here, and they helped her as soon as they found out about problems in the system, while the official authorities, cite, "can only brag and boast in vain and hide their asses behind the bureaucratic talk".

According to his statement, the attempt to break through the Empire's defense lines really had occured, and even as it was fended off, victory took a heavy toll and the victim lists are still being corrected. The governor-general says that this attack should've been well expected, and he repeatedly demanded reinforcements for Muscovy from the MSF General Staff.|His Majesty's Flag Admiral James Hader has in turn expressed a great displeasure in the defeatist mood more expected, as he said, of a cadet fresh to the frontlines than of a governor-general, whose replacement should perhaps be discussed in the current situation.|IGNA - your most authoritative news source.

The investigation started by the Association of system patrols a few months after the start of civil war shows that the governors LeMange, Givens and Bjoskin not only created a network of secret accounts through which plundered untold sums from the reserves, but also laundered money for pirate clans.

And the second one - someone apparently killed Lee Imu, the son of Triada corporation head Min Imu.|The capture of the system, as Imperial media claim, was accomplished by "small blood", but if most of the station population hadn't been evacuated from Al Zed beforehand, it's clear there'd be no "small blood" to speak of. Now the refugees are scattered around several neutral systems, and the resettlement process is still underway. This leads to tensions between "native" population and the refugees: the station equipment is not suited for accepting large crowds of "guests", which leads to problems with healthcare provision and food supply. Our agency addresses the citizens of independent worlds: if your station had been chosen as a temporary refuge for the exiles, please, treat these people with attention, and have patience with the inconveniences.

Only mutual assistance and support in a dark hour guarantees that our neighbors wouldn't leave us to the mercy of fate.|The second topic, Lee Imu's death, can only bring joy to any neutral system citizen. Lee Imu was not only infamous for cruelty, but also for his ties with pirates, slavers and all kinds of criminals. The biography of that scoundrel won't fit into a dozen fat criminal dossiers, and his "feats" caused pain and suffering to thousands of Capricorn Sector citizens.

Unfortunately, as the prosecution noted, after testifying against the most dangerous criminals a man often has to go on the run, fearing revenge from the accused partners in crime. The fear of being killed even after the accused is locked away makes witnesses not only withhold testimony, but even fear reporting to the authorities. This program will provide witnesses with new documents, "clean" biography and certain means to start life anew in a new place.|You're with the Voice of the New Empire, stay tuned.

#M_news_012_7_LDesc = If any citizens of neutral systems had doubts about what sort of order the Empire is about to install, the events in Al Zed set everything in its place. Apparently this is only the start of tumultuous events awaiting the Capricorn Sector. Our agency came to know that the MSF command demanded data on all men and teens who reside in the sector and are fit for regular military service. At the same time the MSF unambiguously hinted at possible problems in case such information is not provided. The news caused large disorders among the population. We found out that the fit draftees already leave stations, remote camps to take refugees are hastily set up on planets. An addition from our redaction: even prior to the civil war the Empire paid little attention to the needs of a vast multitude of systems wishing to remain neutral while the dispute on throne succession rages on. But when the military needs cannon fodder, they quickly remembered about us!|Studio 66 - bringing you news without lies and prejudices.

#M_news_013_1_Name = A low thrust!
#M_news_013_1_LDesc = In recent days Earth and the Outer Worlds are agitated by rumors that the entire Imperial leadership, including His Imperial Majesty, and the MSF command leave their posts without explanation and leave for unknown destinations! Wicked tongues slander them, claiming that the war with the New Empire is lost and so the Emperor and his circle simply ran off, leaving us all to the mercy of fate. We could not reach His Majesty's secretariat, but our reporter occasionally met noble lord Einer Gee who hurried to his shuttle at Earth central spaceport. Calling the rumors nonsense and recommending to stop the panic, noble lord Einer Gee claimed that the Empire is stronger than ever, and His Majesty along with other responsible persons are simply transferred to safety where they won't be threatened by NESF suicide attacks.|Who spreads brazen lies about our leaders and whom does it benefit, that's clear as day. Right now NESF ships are concentrating in near-frontline systems, and it seems that the renegades decided to deal a blow to our fighter's morale with such a low thrust, using rumors and gossip!|IGNA - your most authoritative news source.

#M_news_013_2_Name = Imperial madness
#M_news_013_2_LDesc = It's clear now what the impostor Emperor Azar had in mind when he spoke of turning Old Empire systems into "impregnable strongholds". Our agency received news that the MSF are routinely installing high-powered automatic turrets before inter-system portals and set them on autonomous targeting.|This type of defense weapons was taken off-line a few decades ago due to unstable processor work and program architecture. At the slightest malfunction the automatic turrets went into "panic" mode, shooting at all ships in the field of fire with no distinction. The problem was not solved despite many attempts to do so, and thus the turrets were either used with a removed program block, controlled by live operators, or simply went for conservation. The danger of such systems for surrounding people was so high that no one risked using them even in the war with Berserks and Aliens. "Either everyone in the Old Empire lost their minds, or Azar is intent on drowning the Universe in blood", - stated Corsair.|You're with the Voice of the New Empire, stay tuned.

As our source reports, the system survived several massive assaults by the tincans already, the last of which was nearly fatal. We managed to contact the border guards' leader Zurab Ajani, and he reports that numerous Berserk attacks, previously disordered and unorganized, are now growing in potency - and it seems something or someone is controlling the Berserks. A strange ship of the "Chimera" type was noted on several occasions in the conflict zone, except it's larger and has better guns. According to Zurab, it's hard to say whether it's AL or something new, but true hell's about to break lose in the border systems!|Right now mass evacuation's been announced in X297. According to Zurab Ajani the self-defense forces would hold off the Berserks for as long as they can, but as soon as the last station inhabitant leaves the system, the defenders will also leave for Al Ariash.

Rumor has it that automatic defense systems already sent to their grave a dozen mercenary teams, who were acting - that's important! - in full compliance with MSF registration rules. Moreover, the damned mortars blasted to atoms another dozen mercenary units trying to run through to bordering sectors.|Well, if you got unlucky and stuck somewhere in the Old Empire, our advice is don't go near the portals, but lay low for a while.

#M_news_013_5_LDesc = Trying to prevent the predictable spread of atypical diarrhea epidemic (SRALS), the representatives of Imperial healthcare department addressed the residents of Centaur Sector, asking to avoid contacts with people living and working on orbital stations and try not to travel to other systems. As our reporter gathered, a diversion in Beta Lethera 2 destroyed a peaceful scientific laboratory investigating pathogens and toxins. Unfortunately the administration did not immediately report the breach, and the SRALS virus managed to spread to other systems on transport ships. The symptoms are heavy fatigue, stress, minor temperature increase, strong digestive disorders.

He's declared fugitive for robberies of far greater scale, none of which however brought him even a tenth of what this prize amounts to. According to the authorities, often even law-abiding New Empire citizens properly buying tickets do not claim their prize. Some don't know they got lucky, but mostly the reason is quite sadder: many tickets were bought by NESF active pilots, who died in clashes with the MSF or pirates.| You're with the Voice of the New Empire, stay tuned.

Betrayed by Emperor Azar, by the MSF command, by all whom we completely trusted for a long time...|According to police reports, mass disturbances and panic occurred in several Earth cities. The enforcement agencies cannot cope with the crowds rampaging shops and provision depots. The army units concentrated on defending military installations they are occupying.

#M_news_015_2_LDesc = Our news agency just received information of a Berserker attack on the Free Traders Union headquarters at New Kyoto. According to preliminary reports, the attacking force also had humans in it, and the general coordination was run from a command ship of unknown type. There are grounds to presume the Berserks participating in the New Kyoto raid are connected to the machine armies noticed in the Border Sector. Currently we cannot acquire meaningful explanations from the military or the security service, and the amount of damage caused by the attack to the system and the FTU headquarters, as well as the number of victims, remain unknown.|Meanwhile our agency managed to acquire a security camera record from an FTU station, which clearly displays the profile of the alleged command ship. According to expert opinion, its class is nothing less than a cruiser, and the construction features indicate a large use of technologies created by AM and the Aliens.|Right now a special investigation group has been dispatched to New Kyoto, and the authorities pledged to report information to our agency as soon as they get it.|You're with the voice of the New Empire, stay tuned.

However, the command has noted that space marines' expeditionary corps would not be dispatched to civilian stations and planetary colonies.

Not one led by various political forces and factions, but a fratricidal slaughter! Azar and his cronies disappeared, and we want to wish him a fast but painful death! The MSF can't decide whether to continue fulfilling their duty or just drop it and run, or take advantage of the occasion and turn into pirates (such reports are also present).|Due to these events our agency wants to address the citizens of neutral systems. Keep your neutrality, defend your stations from all who may infringe on your territories, but don't deny help to those who might need it. Unquestionably the war would end soon, the New Empire has de-factor won, but us ordinary people will have to look each other in the eye once the storm calms down. What will we see?

The last scandal broke out because of the decision of the Trustee Council president Shock Lee to remove the world fairy tale collections out of the university libraries and shops. The reason for prohibition were the complaints of one of the students who claimed that the unquotable vocabulary of the novel "Kolobok" and the sex scene in the Little Red Riding Hood insulted his feelings. However, according to other students the Trustee Council abused its power and violated the decree on academic freedoms.

#M_news_015_7_Name = Time to load barrels with officials
#M_news_015_7_LDesc = According to the authorities, the state power of the New Empire, not to mention the system administrations, will shortly experience a severe shortage of officials, even those who have but a basic grasp of civil administration work. Since the beginning of the civil war the wages of New Empire statesmen remained unchanged, while the volume of work rose steadily. Taking into account the expansion of imperial territories, the workload may shortly exceed all sane norms, which already caused a drain of employees from the state to commercial structures. A huge problem is also posed by the fact that Old Empire officials abandon their post and flee, destroying documents, computer databases and connections between civilian service branches. A colossal amount of time and effort would be necessary to restore the damage caused by such actions, and the systems formerly under the Azar IV government would become financial and administrative "black holes" of sorts when transferred under Empress Astra's rule, consuming state funds which are already short. It's still unclear how Her Majesty would solve the situation, however we can't exclude the option of giving administrative functions in New Empire-occupied or annexed systems to the military, not the civil government, for the time being.|You're with the voice of the New Empire, stay tuned.

#M_news_016_1_LDesc = The riots on Earth and in several colonies are quelled by now, but the situation is still heated. In most cities and settlements of the Empire... pardon, the former Old Empire... a curfew has been installed. The police reports that control points are set up in key areas, the airspace and parking orbits of inhabited planets are under complete control. Currently a Crisis Committee composed of the Lower House of Parliament took the authority on Earth. According to the information we have, all Imperial lords, members of influent aristocratic families and Azar's viceroys have left Earth and other systems, either going into hiding or flying into open space. Many of them owned the largest industrial and financial institutions, the assets of which were transferred to unknown accounts, and the database information erased. The audit board appointed by the Crisis Committee found out that the Imperial treasury has likewise been robbed, and a large amount of valuables from the Imperial museum and the Strategic Reserve Fund cargo has been taken out by unknown transports. Even the most cursory approximation shows that these actions have dealt the greatest damage to the Empire's economy for its entire history...|As we cannot currently restore communications sabotaged by the previous fleet command, the Crisis Committee asked our agency to transfer a message for the MSF units serving in Outer Worlds. The message is as following, quote: "Fleet officers and space marines. The war is over, and the Crisis Committee as the legal successor to old Imperial power, has entered peace and disarmament talks with the New Empire. In the nearest times the MSF would be disbanded, and all servicemen not implicated in war crimes would be able to continue service in the NESF, retire, or serve in the system patrols. The Crisis Committee asks you on behalf of the people of the Empire not to enter confrontations with the NESF, but instead help system patrols in struggle with pirates and criminal elements. The new chiefs of the central and regional staff would be shortly appointed to the positions.

Right now the NESF forces fully control the Shula, Tira, Corrino and Aurora systems, and as the New Empire representatives told our agency, civilian ships wishing to enter the Phoenix Sector would not only be freely let in by the military, but also offered escorts if possible. Additional escorts are also offered by the Neutral Systems' Patrol.

No matter how hard I tried, knocking on corporate and Imperial ministry doors, I didn't find out what happened at Beta Lethera 1 and what fate befell my pilots, damn it.|I can't shake off the feeling I share part of the blame for that. When I was approached with an offer to deliver some electronic cargo to a Triada stations and a hefty sum in reward, I thought here's the chance to rise to a new level of business. I rented transports, put trusted pilots to the controls, took mercenary guards. The flight went good, several small clashes with pirates aside, and the convoy even reported on reaching Beta Lethera 1. Then the communication broke down...|Perhaps I shouldn't have tried to jump over my head...|I don't know what happened to my men, but I will certainly find out.

Either I happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, or the Triada pilots were. It seems today's MSF soldiery totally spit upon the law, the Charter of Rights and other documents meant to protect us ordinary inhabitants of this universe from authorities' arbitrariness.

#M_book_001_2_LDesc = I don't like being pressed, and that's how Triada pilots behaved themselves. However, they're pathetic amateurs compared to the MSF, as I found out later. That Viper sure is something - poses as if there are no laws in this world, and all people are her property to be easily disposed of at any moment.|I'm sorry about selling out Triada pilots to the MSF, but what else I had left to do? It turned out I was watched, and I'm sure the soldiery wouldn't hesitate a second if I decided to evade them. Nonetheless, I had my small revanche by giving Triada the documents that I think the imperials were dreaming to get their hands on.|Even though after the MSF patrol incident I even regret not taking a risk and delivering the corporators to Triada itself.

Put guns under people's nose and act like it was me who killed the last Emperor isn't the best way to ensure cooperation. So I'm even glad I’ve managed to do a bad turn to the imperials. And that last incident with the cheeky officer only shored up my opinion.|Hope Viper doesn't recall today if she meets me once again.

Just look at their new fashion of being rude and threatening to everyone around! They'd better watch for the order, the pirates filled up space you can't elbow through these days. So what if I sold out Triada pilots to the imperials, was it my problem?! The pilots share the blame - shouldn't have threatened me! In any case I'm glad I got out safe and unharmed from that story.

So when the corporators are offering a tidy sum for such an easy job there's clearly some trick behind it. Ternie's angry at me for losing what she says is easy money.

We'll have to search for the answers from somebody else - any more contact with the MSF now means only certain trouble for us.

#M_book_007b_1_Name = Logbook entry. "Why Triada"?
#M_book_007b_1_LDesc = So Triada are thinking that a sane person could work for THAT corporation while being kept in the dark?! Perhaps I'm too suspicious of Triada, but I had a feeling of resentment after meeting its representatives in Corrino. Ternie's also supporting me, and she knows of Triada's secret operations more than I do.|In any case we stumbled on an InoCo agent after leaving Triada. I'm not even sure we stumbled upon him and not vice-versa - he seems to have been waiting exactly for us, and in his adversary's space. I have a strong suspicion InoCo's somehow involved with the vanished convoy as well.

#M_book_007b_2_Name = Logbook entry. "Why Triada"?
#M_book_007b_2_LDesc = I'm not sure if agreeing to cooperate with Triada for a while and taking the money was wise, but both Ternie and Greyhair think I've made a mistake. What mistake?! First of all I didn't even agree to anything, and who'd bar me from saying "no" if the mission has a hidden flipside? Nobody! Next, I can return the money anytime - the sum's not that large. Ternie and Greyhair have that habit of making a planet out of a speckle-sized problem sometimes!|P.S. Amusing. It turns out I helped the agent's brother, who is now our customer. So he's now indebted to me! It's unlikely he'd pay back with acting low - after all even Triada shouldn't be that treacherous!

None of the registered teams use grey-painted fighters, and New Empire's supervisor of the center knows nothing about the involvement of any of his mercenaries at Beta Lethera 1. However, we still found a small hook: it turns out I'm not the only one asking about the grey fighters. I'm sure talking to Alexandra Sukhova would shed some light on what happened to the convoy.|While leaving the system we stumbled on that nutty professor whom I helped out on Achilles. He's gathering a new expedition, unguarded once again - he's truly a restless fellow. The Phantom gave me money for that old bucket I got from Ray, and also sent a message to some guy called Corsair, apparently a bigwig in the New Empire. I'm curious - isn't that the Red Corsair, who a few years ago had the whole MSF totally riled up in almost every inhabited system out there?

#M_book_007d_1_LDesc = I couldn't turn down Alex's plea for help, especially as I was sure he wouldn't cope on his own. Capricorn Sector's swarming with pirates, not particularly smart ones, but their boldness more thank makes up for it. The MSF reaction was the real puzzle. Why did they assault everyone without distinction, even when you're trying to avoid a fight?! "Confused you for pirates" - what utter nonsense! I suspect it's all about the cargo we escorted, that's why the thickskulls got so nervous.|Anyway, we got the money, now we can take it to the shops. Of course, it's too bad Alex couldn't find anything out about the missing ships...

Not curious enough to risk my neck trying to put my nose in their secrets, however.|As I presumed, no one's going to share information for free. Alexandra Sukhova heard something about the grey ships and can give me the details only for a service on my part - get some package into a system of the Old Empire. So be it, I can do that, even though it's best to stay away from these spy games (and it's clear without a clairvoyant that's some sort of spy business).|As we left the Gideon system we were attacked by a grey fighter. It's possible they were trailing us and, if Greyhair's right, we're lucky that grey fellow lost his buddies somewhere along the way. Who the hell are they, blackhole take them!

No problem - we'll find the answers elsewhere!

#M_book_007f_1_Name = Logbook entry. "How can InoCo help us?"
#M_book_007f_1_LDesc = So our equation with lots of unknowns got InoCo lumped in as well. Neither I nor Ternie liked that Charles Dickens guy - he's too secretive. And we're again being offered a job without explaining its true nature! I'm so sick of these attempts at manipulation!|Okay, InoCo's not the Triada at least, so I decided to take the job, especially as I get the chance, probably for the first time in a long while, to answer a single question: what sort of cargo stirred up all that turmoil?|P.S. InoCo are adept at displaying their technical superiority. That jump through several systems at once - I didn't even understand how it happened!

There should be mutual trust, and if someone tries to manipulate you - expect trouble to come down on your own head.

#M_book_008a_1_Name = Logbook entry. "Empire's aides"
#M_book_008a_1_LDesc = Just as my friends warned, we shouldn't have even talked to the MSF - well, not to Viper at least. The job that she gracefully endowed us with clearly implies a one-way ticket. See, "simply" take hell knows what from a neutral system and deliver that to a space station of the New Empire. Usually no witnesses are left alive after such missions. Good that we were allowed to simply leave after I refused to dance to Viper's tune. She must've been so busy setting a trap for another simple-minded fool that she forgot to give an order to shoot us. Man, and that's me who said so many times that one should stay away from politics and imperial quarries to myself!

#M_book_008a_2_Name = Logbook entry. "Empire's aides"
#M_book_008a_2_LDesc = Ternie and Greyhair are displeased with me for agreeing with that mission - they suspect a trap. As if I was born yesterday and can't see Viper's attempts at leading us by the nose myself! The only question is what role she has prepared for us in the upcoming play. It may be everything's not that bad, and not worth losing the chance to get information about what happened at Beta Lethera 1 and how the MSF was involved in that.

#M_book_008a_3_Name = Logbook entry. "Empire's aides"
#M_book_008a_3_LDesc = No, I certainly knew the pirates are getting bolder recently, but to be so brazen! It turns out they're capturing entire star systems and posing as the government. A logical step if you think about it - when the legal authorities don't give a damn about their job, various scum rise up and try to grab as much as they can.|I'm glad we helped the locals deal with the pirates. I hope next time they won't tolerate it, hoping for the pirates to leave on their own or moderate their appetite. That would never happen.|Ternie's friend (if you count all her friends space seems like a huge village!), Aylon, gave us some portal map. I'm interested to have a look what those are. He also shed some light on the contents of the container we have to get to Dionysus. "Equipment", hah! I think Viper has some explaining to do if she wants us to agree on that operation.

#M_book_008a_4_Name = Logbook entry. "Empire's aides"
#M_book_008a_4_LDesc = No, I certainly knew the pirates are getting bolder recently, but to be so brazen! It turns out they're capturing entire star systems and posing as the government.

#M_book_008a_5_LDesc = No way, look for fools somewhere else, mistress major, we're done with it! I can't just reject that mission, I'm sure Viper would immediately order to get rid of us.

#M_book_008a_6_Name = Logbook entry. "Empire's aides"
#M_book_008a_6_LDesc = The bomb shouldn't have gone off! Well, actually it should, it's a bomb after all, but not as it did - I trust Viper on this! Her hands may be covered in blood, but can't accuse her of being stupid. It's evident the MSF weren't ready for such a development. Never mind, as soon as Viper finds out who is culpable for the detonation (and she will find out, sooner or later), you could only pity that bastard.|After-pains torment my soul, as if I were responsible for the destruction of the station and deaths of its inhabitants. But I merely delivered the container, that's all! I didn't activate the detonator, I didn't make that bomb, and I'm clearly not at fault for it blowing up at the wrong time!

#M_book_008a_7_Name = Logbook entry. "Empire's aides"
#M_book_008a_7_LDesc = I should've listened to Ternie and Greyhair and rejected that mission. "The timer's set so that everyone has time to escape" - fat chance that! After claiming the bomb is a piece of "equipment", I wouldn't be amazed if the claims about the timer have a catch as well.|To hell with it! We barely fought off the MSF and escaped the system.

Sure, they didn't give us a warm welcome (could've thanked me for preventing the destruction of their station at least), but never mind, I'll cope. Most importantly we wouldn't have innocent blood on our hands. I wonder what the New Empire would do in response? I would be glad to help them run some mean trick on Viper, so that she'd leave this world. Otherwise the damned wretch will certainly try to put a nail into my coffin - that's clear as day.|Anyway, we'll see how it goes.

#M_book_008b_1_Name = Logbook entry. "Triada's job"
#M_book_008b_1_LDesc = That "simple job" looks damn suspicious. A neutral system where experienced Triada soldiers vanish seems a death trap for a team as weak as ours. But it seems the corporators didn't expect me to reject their offer and even forgot about the advance they paid me. Hope they won't suddenly remember about it later...|Another surprise, this one for us, was a meeting with an InoCo agent. It's clear he was seeking our team exactly, and it's also clear that the invitation to the holy of holiest of that corporation is somehow connected with my cargo.|What the hell was that cargo because of which the whole universe now needs me?!

#M_book_008b_2_Name = Logbook entry. "Triada's job"
#M_book_008b_2_LDesc = So that's what Triada calls "strange activity" - InoCo battle groups hiding right under my customer's nose. And Triada dare to claim they knew nothing of it? That the pirates patrolling nearby and tracking me didn't report anything about InoCo ships to anyone?|Enough is enough, if you don't want to play fair I'm likewise out of the deal. Not to mention that only a total idiot would get into a conflict with InoCo.|The flight to Gaeon didn't bring much result, so to say. That pompous fop Charles Dickens clearly knows something about me and the cargo, but he's just laughing and blabbering nonsense, damn swine. The only positive thing in that voyage - we found out about hyperspace portals. I wonder, are there more of them in space, or the only one is between XT-54 and Gaeon?

And what's that ancient rubbish Roghem hinted at? I should look into it when I have spare time.|Triada's information about the attack on the convoy at Beta Lethera 1 gave me almost nothing aside from confirming the deaths of my men.

At the time I believed I was going against trader transports. But our prime task was to deliver the package, and you can't think of a better way to distract the thickskulls than to display maximum loyalty to their cause.

Although... most likely Tito himself had no clue the miners would be so keen on alternative thinking, so to say, that they'd try to solve their problems by gambling. And worse yet, borrowed the money from Triada.|Regardless, the miners were my true customers, so I gave the cargo to them. Pity that my relations with Triada went sour because of it, but I'll cope somehow. Still, it's nice to see the miner treat me as a hero of sorts, and promise to assist in changing my ship numbers at any time. That would be handy.|Enough losing time, Alex awaits me at Charon.

To rise to shark status, we had to first become "mollusks", then "gudgeons" and finally "crabs". That whole path was accompanied by quite humiliating and often painful "upbringing process". But one day a rumor went through the academy that a newbie's coming, who just retired from space infantry.

Even as Dickens promised a few squads to help, I'm really doubtful we could pass the guard of two Triada systems, then assault the station and finally escape. All systems would have such an alarm raised as soon as InoCo ships arrive that we'd just get crushed like bugs.|Moreover, I agree with Ternie: if the cargo's so valuable and can usher a new era in electronics, my crew can become unwanted witnesses, with all the following consequences.|Dunno, I don't like that Dickens. Why can he only dispatch a limited corporation force, not a powerful strike group? Why no other InoCo directors were present at the meeting? Why the hell do they need my help? Well sure, if the cargo's in containers the lock can't be opened without my bioparameter data, and lock picking would lead to self-destruction of contents. But why not just seize the containers and bring them here?|More questions than answers, and I'm not risking our necks in that adventure.|P.S.

I should've listened to Greyhair and Ternie and refused that idea straightaway.|Okay, at least we're alive. Plus we kept the advance paid by the corporators, and we found out about these strange portals. Man, one jump through several sectors at once! I wonder where do the other portals of that network lead to? That information could be useful. However, putting our foot near XT-54 again doesn't seem wise to me.

Intuition which rises at the borders of your conscience and often gives a good advice even if you have no logical explanation for your actions. When Meyer started to mumble about some written-off InoCo equipment, MSF presence in a corporate system, I had immediate suspicion that it looks crooked. Not only did he go for the cargo without a transport, but also remained in a system that was blasted with wild abandon by the MSF. Too atypical for a trader.

I wonder if the principle "my enemy's enemy is my friend" can be applied here, or it's best to be more vigilant? Aja says Triada boss Min Imu is somehow related to the Greys. But with which Greys?! Damn it, they could've at least identify some sort of differences among them - for example, one group would be just grey and the other grey with dots. But it seems too late to ask them of such a favor, and now I'll have to be constantly watching my back.|And it seems we can't wiggle out of being noble vigilantes who will relieve space from Min Imu and the grey plague, as well as turn Triada into a corporation not marred by pirate company. Although I still giggle about the latter. In any case, me and my crew will be the first fiddle playing Aja's score. And I hope no one shoots the pianist during our performance.

Now we'd have to fight an organization with unknown resources and based in unknown locations. Of course, Alexandra promised NESF help, but that doesn't calm me at all, since we've seen no real help until now.|We're heading to XT-86 for a meeting with an MSF admiral.

He knew, but kept me in the dark...|No, he offered solid explanations of his motives, and I understand and accept it. Especially as he continued to investigate my incident. But on the other hand, someone fooled once would be more careful next time, and now when Alex needs our help I have an ill feeling that he hides another joker down his sleeve and isn't all that candid.|Although... Everything Alex said perfectly fits the big picture. More than that, Cayer's confessions also add to it (bless The Space for giving idiots a habit to confess of their evil schemes right before dying). At least I figured out who hunted my head, what happened to the cargo, why someone had to kill my men and who are the guys manning grey fighters. Only two questions left to solve: what was the cargo, and how does Alex along with his Grey "companions" intend to get out of this situation? I'll know the answers very soon, but for now Alex and Cleric are right, it's best to get away from XT-24 somewhere where we can think over it all in a calmer environment.

You both spent a lot of time together, went through a lot of troubles, but in that moment of truth you realize you know nothing about the one you called a friend. As if you betrayed your friend and even the very memory of him.|When we buried Ternie (at that time as it seemed, at least), this feeling consumed me. And a fierce lust for avenging the Greys for her death. The rest didn't matter at all. Flying through the InoCo's space, we witnessed a clash between the former director of the corporation and those who were on its Council. And who designed and invented SAM. I saw it as merely a spectacle not related to us at all, but only afterwards from SAM's information I found out Reynolds was part of that grey gang, and not the last man there. Too bad I didn't know that before, I'd help with arresting the former director.|SAM says the Greys didn't agree on sharing something and split in two factions. And we're heading to give a trashing to the one that has nothing to do with Ternie's murder. To be frank, I'm bothered by this - neither me nor my friends are cold-blooded butchers and we aren't used to shooting at people who had done nothing bad to us. I'm also quite frightened by the multitude of Berserks we saw at Zebos, even as our new ally assures the damned tincans are now strictly under control and pose no danger to ordinary people.|I understand and accept SAM's logic - yes, Greys are Greys, all of them are the same. If the ones who settled at the FTU station in New Kyoto made us no trouble, that doesn't mean they were so kind and courteous to others. So we'll do a great favor to humanity in any case, as for those guilty of my companion's death, they shall pay for their crimes in time.|P.S. Turns out one set of Greys tried to deal with other Greys using me and my crew. Even spiders in a jar look more sympathetic to me, from a moral point of view - at least they fight on their own.|P.P.S. Before we left Zebos, SAM reported some more news. So amazing and wonderful that I even fear to dictate it to the logbook not to overlook the hope. But I can't be silent either. The InoCo specialists managed to take an electronic copy of Ternie's personality, and we just have to transfer it to a computer and activate. As of now this procedure is too new, but SAM promised to improve it. Could I really talk to Ternie once more? Could I apologize for being late with help? For not even asking what her real name was?

I have to admit, Inoco scientists have jumped over their head and created a real monster - cunning, insidious, perfectly understanding human motives. Still underestimating humans, though. We barely broke out from Zebos, replacing the "gift" base ship for an ordinary transport, which allowed us to safely pass the hyperspace vortex of the portal. Then we made it to New Kyoto, where a new surprise awaited us. Turned out Alex knew everything about the Greys, more than that, he was something like a director of this circus tent.

Nowe Kyoto jest wystarczajaco daleko od linii frontu i prawdopodobnie przetrwa obecna burze.

Chociaz - coz moge powiedziec - bylem wtedy zupelnie innym czlowiekiem...|Zadalismy Min Imu kolejny cios, taki, ktory powinien odczuc przez sama glebie swojej zgnilej duszy. Prawdopodobnie nie zywil cieplych uczuc do swojej przybranej corki, ale utrata glownego ksiegowego korporacji wyraenie zwroci jego uwage.
